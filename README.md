## AI Academy (CARL)

### Context
I received the Aitra Legacy Courses as raw video. Goal: transform passive, hard-to-navigate content into a modern learning experience that surfaces key ideas and enables structured study.

### Action
Built a React + Supabase platform and used OpenAI Whisper to transcribe long-form videos. Added workflows to convert transcripts into structured courses—timestamped navigation, summaries, and interactive lessons—demonstrating a repeatable “video → course” pipeline.

### Result
Shipped AI Academy featuring the full Cohort 2 curriculum (22 lessons across 9 weeks). The repo also illustrates a reusable pipeline (via Modular Mind) for converting legacy video libraries into interactive courses—suitable as an open-source tool, an MVP agency service, or a SaaS foundation.

### Learning
Beyond mastering transcription + structure + platform design, I validated that AI can productize static video into new workflows and business models (video → structured learning). This originated as a personal Gauntlet 2 challenge to sharpen AI-native builder skills.
